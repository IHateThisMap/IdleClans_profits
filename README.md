# IdleClans_profits
Made some scripts for fun to help seeing what things are most worth it to do/sell/(maybe even buy) in the game at the current moment.

.

# Quick setup:
1. First open terminal in a folder you want to put these things in.
2. And then clone this repo and py_script_launcher_UI repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/IHateThisMap/IdleClans_profits.git
git clone https://github.com/IHateThisMap/py_script_launcher_UI.git
```
move to the cloned IdleClans_profits repo folder
```
cd IdleClans_profits
```
Now you can check minumum and maximum profits of farming with:
```
python idleClansFarmingProfits.py ui
```
OR profits of making titanium bars or potions with:
```
python idleClansProductProfit.py ui
```
(note that this is/was just a casual little project that I did for fun in a few evenings :D)
